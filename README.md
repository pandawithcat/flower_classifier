# Flower Classifier

This is a tutorial for begineers interested in machine learning full stack development.
I'll be using react for frontend and django backend to create a simple flower classifier app.
I would love to have a demo linked here but running kubernetes clusters is kind of expensive so I've decided just to upload the code and the docker files. Specific steps/tutorials for client and the server are in the subdirectories respectively!

## Client Features

- [x] Allow image upload
- [ ] Allow image labeling
- [ ] Allow users to trigger model re-training

## Server Features

- [ ] Pre-train the model
- [x] Make endpoint that receives an image(flower) and returns the prediction
- [ ] Make endpoint that receives an image and the data(label)
- [ ] Make endpoint that allows model re-training

## Overall Featuers

- [ ] Dockerize both client and the server
- [ ] Write one docker compose file
- [ ] Run on kubernetes

# Note

I couldn't upload the trained model cuz it's too big(over 300mb). So i'll write down some descriptions on how to run this thing soon.
